    <!-- id?
    In HTML, the "id" selector is used id attribute of an element. For an HTML element, the "id" name starts with the symbol '#' followed by a unique name.
    example: -->

    <h1>Get elements by id</h1>
    <p id="demo">This is id attributes Example</p>


    <!-- class?
    In HTML, the "class" selector is used to select an element with a specific class attribute. The class selector starts with a period (.) followed by a class name. Unlike the id selector, we can attach multiple selector to an HTML element. Therefore, the class can be applied many time within a page. The important point to note about the class selector is that the class name must not be started with a number.-->
    
    <!-- example:  -->

    <h1>Get element by class</h1>
    <p class="Demo">This Is Class Attributes Example</p>
    
</body>

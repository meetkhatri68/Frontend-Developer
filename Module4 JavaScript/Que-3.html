    <!-- What is negative Infinity?

    NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a property of the JavaScript Number object.

    You can only use it as Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY.

    Using x.NEGATIVE_INFINITY, where x is a variable, will return undefined:

    Example:-
    let x = 100;
    x.NEGATIVE_INFINITY; -->

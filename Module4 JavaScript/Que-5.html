    <!-- What are undeclared and undefined variables?


    Ans.->
    1.Undeclared Variables:

    An undeclared variable is a variable that has been used in code without being formally declared (defined) using a declaration statement such as var, let, or const (depending on the programming language).
    If you try to use a variable without declaring it first, the interpreter or compiler may raise an error. Undeclared variables can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior in a program.

    Example:
    // Undeclared variable
    console.log(x);  // Error: x is not defined

    2.Undefined Variables:

    An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. In many programming languages, when a variable is declared but not initialized, its default value is often undefined.
    It's important to distinguish between undeclared and undefined variables. An undeclared variable hasn't been declared at all, while an undefined variable has been declared but doesn't currently have a value assigned to it.

    Example:
    // Declared but undefined variable
    var y;
    console.log(y);  // undefined -->

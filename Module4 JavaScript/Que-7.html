    What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?


    ViewState?
    -> Maintained at page level only.
    -> View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages.
    -> It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring.
    -> Information is stored on the client’s end only.
    -> used to allow the persistence of page-instance-specific data.
    -> ViewState values are lost/cleared when new page is loaded.

    SessionState?
    -> Maintained at session level.
    -> Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.
    -> In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed or there is session expiration.
    -> Information is stored on the server.
    -> used for the persistence of user-specific data on the server’s end.
    -> SessionState can be cleared by programmer or user or in case of timeouts.
